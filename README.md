# Sudoku
Sudokusolver
The files Loeser.py and LoeserNeu.py are programs you can start in your powershell and where you can open one of the .txt files
which includes some Sudokus. The program LoeserNeu.py is the latest and fixed some bugs. The algorithm in these two files can only
solve easy Sudoku.

The Python file Solver.py includes the function superloeser, which can instead solve also hard Sudoku.

There are only four interesting .txt files:
LeichtesSudoku.txt is an easy Sudoku
Sudoku.txt is an medium hard Sudoku
Schwer.txt is an hard Sudoku
SehrSchwer.txt is and pretty hard Sudoku
The algorithm superloeser is able to solve all of them. It might only be a small sample but I am happy it works :D

The other .txt files where only to find bugs in the programs Loeser.py and LoeserNeu.py.
